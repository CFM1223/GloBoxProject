In the scope of this project, our objective was to meticulously analyze whether the introduction of a new banner, showcasing food and drink items, had a discernible impact on the conversion rates of customers 
on the e-commerce store. Employing a comprehensive toolkit, including SQL, Excel, Statistical Analysis, and Tableau, we delved into the raw data to derive meaningful insights.

Throughout the project, our analysis unveiled a significant difference in conversion rates between groups A and B. However, an in-depth examination revealed that this increase in conversion did not correlate with 
a discernible rise in consumer spending. This finding prompted a nuanced exploration into the factors influencing user behavior and the ultimate impact on the business's bottom line.

To conclude this project, we compiled our insights into a comprehensive technical report. In addition, we crafted easily understandable visualizations and slides using Tableau, ensuring that our findings were 
effectively communicated to our business stakeholders. This meticulous reporting process not only summarized our discoveries but also provided actionable insights for strategic decision-making within the context of 
the e-commerce store's marketing strategy.
